Issue No 01:
    while running "sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 --kubernetes-version 1.24.0" command on ubuntu 22.04 Focal received below error.
    Error:
        [ERROR CRI]: container runtime is not running: output: time="2023-02-05T08:50:42Z" level=fatal msg="validate service connection: CRI v1 runtime API is not
        implemented for endpoint \"unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock\": rpc error: code = Unimplemented desc = unknown service runtime.v1.RuntimeService"
    Solution:
        By searching the web it appears this is an issue with the old containerd provided by Ubuntu 20.
        solved it with the following steps (as root):
        1. Set up the Docker repository as described in https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository
        2. Remove the old containerd: apt remove containerd
        3. Update repository data and install the new containerd: apt update && apt install containerd.io
        4. Remove the installed default config file: rm /etc/containerd/config.toml
        5. Restart containerd: systemctl restart containerd
        The kubeadm init command worked fine afterwards.

Issue No 02:
  Error: CrashLoopBackOff Error in Kubernetes
  Solution:
    The K8S kubelet will wait an increasing ‘backoff’ time between crashes before attempting to start the pod again. The K8S restartPolicy is set to ‘always’ by default.
    This can also occur if the restartPolicy has been changed to ‘onFailure.’
    When a pod shows the CrashLoopBackoff status, it means it is waiting for the given time specified by the ‘backoff’ to restart and will likely fail again.

Issue No. 03:
Error: pod status was showing the ImagePullBackOff 
Solution: The status ImagePullBackOff means that a container could not start because Kubernetes could not pull a container image (for reasons such as invalid image name, or pulling from a private registry without imagePullSecret ).

Issue No. 04: Statefulset
    Error: 0/3 nodes are available: pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims. preemption: 0/3 nodes are available: 3 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling. 
    Solution: 
        This error I received because I did not mentioned the Storage class in my manifest file. To get the definitive error statement, you can run the following command:
            kubectl describe  pvc www-web-0(persistent volume name assigned to statefulset)
        you will notice something like: storageclass.storage.k8s.io "my-storage-class" not found
        You can run the following command to get your cluster's available storage class and replace it in yaml file.
            kubectl get sc
